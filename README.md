# King County Social Media search app

Redesign of [King County Social Media page](https://www.kingcounty.gov/about/news/social-media.aspx). 

## Get Starteds

1. **Install [Node](https://nodejs.org)**. Need to run multiple versions of Node? Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
2. **Fork this repository.** -  [How to fork a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
2. **Clone your forked repository.** - `git clone https://github.com/your-repo.git`.

This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. When doing development with this kit, this command will continue watching files all your files. Every time you hit save the code is rebuilt, linting runs, and tests run automatically. Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.
